Results on an 8-core (hyperthreading) machine:
1. Primes:
	4x speedup for n = 10000000

2. PI:
	perform better than C# versions
	8x speedup with Parallel.ForEach, 5.5x speedup with PLINQ

3. NQueens:
	perform better than C# versions.
	8x speedup when pre-placing the first two queens (N = 14).

4. Sudoku:
	Failed to parallelize its depth-first search algorithm.

5. Strassens:
	perform better than C# version, but scalability seems to be strange.
	7x speedup for the standard algorithm, 6x speedup for Strassen's algorithm.

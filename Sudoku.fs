// A failed attempt to parallelize a sudoku solver.

// Lessons learned:
// 1. Depth-first search is difficult to parallelize (they are soon to be completed).
// 2. It's hard to ensure correctness when doing mutation inside the grid.
// 3. The waitAny implementation is slow, due to large overheads.
